# Where to get textures?
One of my favorite websites to get high quality textures from is Texturelabs texturelabs.com https://texturelabs.org/

To add
+ Preset folder path will be created with textures inside (from texturelabs?)
+ information tab explaining how the script works and where to find presetfolder path etc.
+ Tooltips for buttons
+ Support for video files, with preview
+ Different color for video and image
+ Move towards overlay library than just texture
+ Stylized UI
+ Support for GLB files (!?)
+ Add with blending mode
+ FIX START OF VIDEO OVERLAYS BEING CUT OFF when imported not at start of timeline (move video to start of layer selected instead of cutting line for the textures)
+ "Open target folder" (Like opening video)

# How to install
Go to your after effects install > Support Files > Scripts > ScriptUI Panels > Put script in that folder. 
i.e. C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects 2024\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels
